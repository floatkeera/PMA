# PMA

PMA is a Product Management Application built for Android. The current application acts as the client-side online shopping app.

## What technology does PMA use?

PMA uses Firebase for all data transactions using the real-time database, authentication, cloud storage and cloud messaging.
Other open-source libraries are also utilized to help with the UI/UX including Android-SpinKit.

## Prototype design

Prior to making the mobile application, I designed the UI elements and prototyped them with proto.io. You can view the web version [here](https://floatkeera.github.io/PMAprototype)
